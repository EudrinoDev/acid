## About & Links

I've been working hard on version 1.1.0 of Acid - the Snow Leopard release. Here are some links to get you started quickly and easily. Acid's GitHub repository can be found [here](https://github.com/iamtheblackunicorn/acid). This link includes a lot of documentation for any audience. Acid's theme registry can be found [here](https://blckunicorn.art/acid-themes). Acid's page on Rust's package registry can be found [here](https://crates.io/crates/acid-rs).
