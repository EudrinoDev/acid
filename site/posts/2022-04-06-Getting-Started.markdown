## Get Started

Acid is very friendly to its users, to get started and learn about how to build your first Acid site, I highly recommend reading the tutorial [here](https://github.com/iamtheblackunicorn/acid/blob/main/docs/TUTORIAL.markdown) or checking out Acid's repository on GitHub [here](https://github.com/iamtheblackunicorn/acid).
