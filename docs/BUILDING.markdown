# BUILDING

## Tools

You will need the following tools installed and available from the command line:

- Rust: Install the toolchain from [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/).
- Git: Download Git for your system from [here](https://git-scm.com/).

## Steps

- 1.) Get the source code:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/iamtheblackunicorn/acid.git
```

- 2.) Change directory:

```bash
$ cd acid
```

- 3.) Build the source code:

```bash
$ cargo build --release
```

This will produce an executable binary here: `target/release`.
