# CONTRIBUTING

If you would like to contribute, there are two options:

- File an issue and suggest a new feature. I will implement this if I like the sound of your suggestion.
- Fork the repository, clone the fork, add your code, test your changes, and file a Pull Request with a brief explanation of what your addition does. If I think the addition is sensible, I will merge your branch with the `main` branch.
